# eDemy - Career Counselling

India's Best AI Powered Career Counseling Platform

## How does our software work ?

Jobs are determined by skills, while careers are influenced by personalities. Keeping this principle in mind, we have developed innovative software that utilizes personality and adaptive technology solutions.

Our journey begins with a user-friendly landing page where users provide basic information. Subsequently, users are engaged with character-based questions designed to predict their RIASEC (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional) model. Based on user input, we accurately determine their dominant character trait, achieving an impressive 90% accuracy with the SVM (Support Vector Machine) model, as validated on our dataset.

Next, leveraging adaptive technology, our software shortlists the best-suited career options based on the user's dominant character trait. We have incorporated a special feature catering to differently-abled individuals, ensuring inclusivity in our career counseling test. Users can access detailed career roadmaps generated with the assistance of AI and receive a comprehensive report.

Furthermore, our platform boasts additional features such as an AI-driven career counseling chatbot, multilingual support, and the option to engage in conversations with industry professionals.

## How do we plan to generate revenue ?

In our software, we offer several free features, including an AI chat, multilingual support, career roadmap, and a psychometric test. Additionally, we provide premium features such as a report generator after the psychometric test and the ability to chat with a professional counselor.

We currently offer three subscription packages:

* eDemy Silver Plan: Users receive no counselor session, but they get 30 minutes of counseling and can download 5 reports for ₹399. This plan has a time limit of 1 month.

* eDemy Gold Plan: Users receive 1 counselor session of 30 minutes and can download 7 reports for ₹499. This plan has no time limit.

* eDemy Platinum Plan: Users receive 5 counselor sessions of 30 minutes each and can download 10 reports for ₹999. This plan also has no time limit.

These subscription packages are designed to cater to varying needs and preferences, providing users with a range of options to enhance their experience and receive personalized guidance.
